I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at University of Washington. I did my undergraduate in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) with a minor in English literature. At IITK, I was advised by [Prof. Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io) from the Department of Mathematic and Statistics.

I have explored different topics in statistics through my undergraduate research spanning sampling methods and numerical optimization. I worked with Prof. Vats on autocovariance estimation from parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo implementations. In collaboration with Prof. Vats and [Prof. Victor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/), I developed stopping rules using effective sample size in importance sampling. A recent work in collaboration with [Prof. Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/) targeted acceleration of MM algorithms using quasi-Newton method.

Apart from research in statistics, I enjoy dancing and reading fiction. I spend my free time exploring the great coffee of Seattle.
